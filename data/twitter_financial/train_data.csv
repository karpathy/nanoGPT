$LI is now consolidating for three weeks in a tight flag after a 120% up move in seven weeks off the bottom.   Watch for a break above this descending trend line and through the top of the flag at 41.49.  https://t.co/j9t2GEDeUm,18
$CELH clears a short flag or a low handle at 80.35 on heavy volume as it works on the right side of a large consolidation.  https://t.co/pAuM5DW4b3,18
$SWAV clears the descending trend line of a large consolidation and the 200 Century Mark on light volume.  RS line is at a new high.  https://t.co/O5zLosYNAW,18
$HALO reclaims the cup with handle / flat base pivot of 48.58 after finding support at the 21-day EMA. It shows accumulation with 6 consecutive up weeks and blue skyscrapers within the base.  https://t.co/jxVq3h7NqB,18

@Stock_Inf0 Yep.,18
$ABBV stop hit. The trade closed lost right near $5 a share.  Not all trades work. Next.,18
$MSFT  I do own shares in this name. no chart posted when buought,18
$GOOGL daily back over and holding a confluence of MA's. Indicators are reset and ready if price wants higher. ER next week. (position),18
$WMT daily chart trying to break higher out to the base and gap area. Indicators reset and ready if price wants higher. I put a volume by price bar on this chart to show overhead supply.  I know many who hold/trade this name  https://t.co/cfhtIx4Of3,18
$NKE  updated chart daily back over 50ma 10/21ma bull cross. RSI back over 50 MACD turning up  https://t.co/0TXSsINJqk,18
$NVDA updated chart.  Now that price is over the 50ma I am watching the June gap. RSI back over 50.  10/21ma bull cross.  Chart looking better  https://t.co/nqEFHxotkF,18
$XBI daily another base break higher  https://t.co/qGCo81LKP7,18
$NVDA back over yesterday high.   Going to take my paydays soon,18
The day is good when @HCPG  is in my stream and posting charts.  TY,18
$NVDA never did sell my payday shares yesterday I am watching close again today to take them off and get down to swing size,18
$QCOM close to being able to put some into let it ride.  It just hit the day high list again.  No action taking on my holding at this time,18
top 4 ETF's from a list I watch right now = $SMH $XBI $XRT $XOP,18
$HAS boring name but showing some dumpster dive potential. ER behind the name with good response.  Ex-date soon. I took on a position today.  https://t.co/YlOf1SrKw6,18
@pawan1234o @Ed_Hale @johnscharts @ClutchBP @Striff17 @trijoey $AMZN confirmed ER 7-28 after the close,18
$XLE today's new trade I have put in a break even or make a little coin stop.,18
@daveBer05277367 END of day only wouldn't want yesterday low to be lost.  Intraday if planning on a swing have to give it room.  Or you can be quick to raise your stop to no green to red and see what happens.  ATR (14) daily = 2.82 Trade your plan not my noise,18
$XLE strong off the open (position),18
$AAPL stop hit all out of the remainder of the trade made great coin.  Name goes back on go to list/watch,18
$SPY H1 chart lately one could trade the RSI 70/30 been great clue to be short or long. Observation at this time flat on SPY at this time,18
$AAPL bracket order hit for a rung of the ladder made good loot. Still own shares,18
$AFRM with a gap up triangle base break up and out today. None here.  Seems I saw the chart in @traderstewie stream recently.,18
"For me and my position on $NVDA the big level on watch 176.97-177 area.  All in time.  Right now I am watching the 50ma daily then 168.69, 171 area, 173 area.",18
$NVDA has an ATR (14) daily currently $8.49 it is up over $10 on the day. (holding it here).  Price made an attempt over 50ma and is battling it now,18
$SMH top 5 holdings $TSM $NVDA $TXN $QCOM $INTC  Now this one I was right on a few of them and I do own some of them,18
"$XRT top 5 holdings $CHWY $GO $OLLI $RAD $DG  surprised me, how about you?",18
$XRT currently has 101 holdings in this ETF. If I asked you to name the top 5 holdings could you?  I couldn't was surprised when I looked at the list. $COST is #7  I will list the top 5 next,18
$WMT 130.64 is gap fill and 131.35 confirms. Daily chart,18
"$SMH watching $218.81, 220.44 the 50ma daily then June 10 low 223.42.  Trading an ETF keeps ER season a bit easier, spreading risk and don't have to sell if not a let it ride.",18
Looking to take my payday shares off on $NVDA today.  watching it,18
$AMZN back to the 116-116.10 area. I am watching same levels I gave last week.  Still holding it here,18
top sector ETF's right now $XOP $XME $XLE $XRT  (I own some or individual names within the sector),18
"$AMZN until the 15 and 30 min charts base this is going to be hard to get more from it. Not a lot of time left in the day. My opinion, your wallet and trade plan.",18
Perfect example when I gave short term levels for $AMZN I was thinking if it gets to 115.23 that will probably be it. Then next level was 115.54 and 115.60. So far high of day 115.59.  Don't tell price where it is going let it show you.  Watch the candles they light our path,18
Folks I have a swing trade on $AMZN just having fun with the lower time frame charts.  To entertain and teach,18
$AMZN the 15/30 min chart is stretched and going to need basing soon,18
Now we have our 115.54 $AMZN  if day trading one can inch up the stop / ladder some or wait for the next candle to light your way.,18
$AMZN current daily ATR (14) is $5.09,18
"Just for fun if we stay with the AMZN 30 min chart we can watch 115.54 once 115.23 holds convincingly.  then 115.60, 115.75  and the 116.10 bigger picture/time frame",18
$AAPL is all about the 150 level imo,18
I am having fun giving levels I am watching.  Also seeing other traders I have a lot of respect for posting levels on $AMZN.  Thanks to all,18
$AMZN a 30 min chart shows the 115.23 level clearly.,18
$AMZN made our 115 the number watching the most for me is June 9 low of day 116.10.  If look at an H1 chart 115.23 is next,18
Some names reporting next week. price over $20 trade 1 million or more shares a day  https://t.co/ESZPzfXavu,18
Names that reported ER in the previous 5 days with price over $20 and trade 1 million shares or more a day.  Sector and industry included.  https://t.co/whr8QyRJAB   ER season is a good time to make a go to list if you don't have one. Use your own parameters  $STUDY,18
"$AMZN levels on my radar if price wants higher A hold over 114.30, 115ish and then the June 9 lod = 116.10 former gap area. (full swing position here)",18
$WMT into the May 18 gap daily.  Not a great stick so far for a break out of a base.  The close is what counts.,18
$MSFT with a gap and go stick on the daily. Back over 10/21 next up is the 50ma.  (position today),18
$ABBV still in the base. Gap up today over the 50/100ma. Also note the bull cross 21/50ma RSI holding 50. This name went ex-dividend yesterday.  https://t.co/Ss8oTwUcnr,18
$AMZN took my payday shares off with the gap up made $4 a share profit on this group now I settle into the full swing trade.,18
Hello stock fans.  Gap ups offer an opportunity to ladder some and / or inch up stops.,18
I am underwater on $ABBV but stop not hit. It did go ex-dividend today.,18
I did keep $COST and $QCOM trades.  posted charts etc earlier,18
$TSLA day trade taken off near the close.  It didn't reach the price I needed to swing it.  I made great $ and will look at it again tomorrow.,18
$QCOM bracket order hit on the payday shares. Made great coin. Now I settle into the full swing position and in time if all goes well let it ride.,18
$TSLA struggled at $700 then $704 next level up for me is 710.49,18
$AMZN red to green on the day (I do own this name),18
$COST chart to go with all my yammering today  https://t.co/qG2ZThABBO,18
$COST a beast of a day for this name. 200ma daily next on my radar.,18

"$COST has reached its ATR(14) of 13.09. if thinking time to take payday shares, drop down time frames and stalk.",18
COST 505-506 area next level to watch IMO,18
$AAPL red to green (still holding it here),18
$QCOM daily base breaking higher like to see 136.69 hold by days end.  Next short term level high I am watch 137.45 move and hold over.,18
$COST getting some lift.  I know many in this name,18
$GME been in day high list 3 days in a row.  None here observation.  Congrats if you took it,18
$QCOM worth a look (position),18
@AltitudeChaz $COST and $QCOM too,18
$UUP hitting the 52 week high list. Observation,18
$ABBV posted chart and trade a few days back @alphatrends reminding us of the ex-dividend,18

The $ES Gap and Run this morning was clearly the way to go. Been saying that for years.,18
The $ES short was triggered and sold off 50 points right to the next level and more. Offers below 3753 will bring it to fill an imortant Gap at 3711.75-3719.25,18
"It's nice going to bed with a $1,000+ per contract already made and still looking good. It could move 150 points before the next real resistance.",18

The $ES is trading in the middle of two Gaps that are about 300 points wide. Last week the weekly Upside Gap was filled and now is back on the way down. My guess the next stop is the Downside Gap at 3711.75-3719.25,18
Short $AD if the open is below 69302 and goes offered below the open. Look for 69090-69100 as minor support. Offers below 69090 will send it down to some good support at 68390-68400,18
$AD Equilibrium is 69302  Look to get long if it goes bid above 69302 or the Open is above 69302 and goes bid above the open. Minor resistance is 69700-69701.  Bids above 69701 will take it to 69980-69990.,18
