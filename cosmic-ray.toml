# Execution engine

# What to mutate: top-level package module path(s)

# Command to run tests. Keep it deterministic and quiet-ish.
[cosmic-ray.test]
# Uses uv if present; the helper script will wrap with `uv run` automatically.

# Operators: keep default set; override selectively if you want to focus runs.
# Example to focus only on arithmetic ops:
# [cosmic-ray.operator-filter]
# only = ["core/NumberReplacer", "core/ArithmeticOperatorDeletion"]
