# Checkpointing System Requirements (Relocated)

All checkpointing, configuration, and dataset lifecycle requirements now live in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). Refer to that document for the authoritative specification, diagrams, and runtime responsibilities.

This file is retained temporarily as a pointer to avoid breaking existing deep links. Update bookmarks and references to target `ARCHITECTURE.md` going forward.
