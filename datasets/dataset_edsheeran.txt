i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no   i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart covered the planet i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no i'll take it back now   now i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worstdressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  4 my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme till i deliver the hype am i just living a lie with this you must know that the numbers just sold will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 percent of it when we wake but the other 0 percent it never fades dreaming dreams of daytoday goals stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh never give up just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors now i'm sweating on the stage of a soldout tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow igh

i should ink my skin with your name and take my passport out again and just replace it see i could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle and i should run you a hot bath fill it up with bubbles 'cause maybe you're loveable maybe you're my snowflake and your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place and you should never cut your hair 'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  hook and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up   and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way and i know you love shrek 'cause we've watched it  times and maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too and if your dvd breaks today you should've got a vcr because i've never owned a bluray true say i know i've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me and if i lost i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv and then you laugh at me and be asking me if i'm gonna be home next week and then you lie with me 'til i fall asleep and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  hook and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up   and i think you hate the smell of smoke you always try and get me to stop but you drink as much as me and i get drunk a lot so ill take you to the beach and walk along the sand and i'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand and i'll carve it like this necklace so the heart falls where your chest is now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be and rests peacefully so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now against yours now cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up maybe i fell in love when you woke me up
it's just another night and i'm staring at the moon i saw a shooting star and thought of you i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew if you were here i'd sing to you you're on the other side as the skyline splits in two i'm miles away from seeing you but i can see the stars from america i wondered do you see them too   so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home   i can hear your heart on the radio beat they're playing chasing cars and i thought of us back to the time you were lying next to me i looked across and fell in love so i took your hand back through lamp lit streets i knew everything led back to you so can you see the stars over amsterdam you're the song my heart is beating to   so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home   and oh i know and oh i know and oh i can see the stars from america
now i don't wanna hate you just wish you'd never gone for the man and waited two weeks at least before you let him take you i stayed true i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school he's waiting for the time to move i knew he had his eyes on you he's not the right guy for you don't hate me 'cause i write the truth no i would never lie to you but it was never fine to lose you and what a way to find out it never came from my mouth you never changed your mind but you were just afraid to mind out but fuck it i won't be changing the subject i love it i'll make your little secret public it's nothing i'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me trapped and i'm lacking sleep fact is you're mad at me because i backtrack so casually you're practically my family if we married then i'll guess you'd have to be but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot i think not   i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore   recently i tend to zone out up in my headphones to holocene you promised your body but i'm away so much i stay more celibate than in a monastery i'm not cut out for life on the road 'cause i didn't know i'd miss you this much and at the time we'd just go so sue me i guess i'm not the man that you need ever since you went to uni i've been sofa surfing with a rucksack full of less cash and i guess that could get bad but when i broke the industry that's when i broke your heart i was supposed to chart and celebrate but good things are over fast i know it's hard to deal with and see this i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features then i turn the music off and all i'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus i never really want to believe this got advice from my dad and he told me that family is all i'll ever have and need i guess i'm unaware of it success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with   i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore   and since you left i've given up my days off it's what i need to stay strong i know you have a day job but mine is 47 i feel like writing a book i guess i lied in the hook 'cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could the irony is if my career in music didn't exist in 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid i'm frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it's just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i'm trying to kill and i'd be writing my will before i'm 7 i'll die from a thrill go down in history as just a wasted talent can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing alice it's only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me eventually i'll be fine i know that it was never meant to be either way i guess i'm not prepared but i'll say this these things happen for a reason and you can't change shit take my apology i'm sorry for the honesty but i had to get this off my chest   i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore

oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now  and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie with draw strings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone  watching blue planet creating new habits then as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can't help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i'm not saying we should be taking a break just reevaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane but in a day we'll have to say it again  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina uh won't you leave me now now  love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won't you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back go oh won't you leave me now  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both in a road won't you leave me now now

shoes i give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song since they are

absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinth can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we

well the road is wide waters run on either side and my shadow in the fading light is stretching out towards the night when the sun is low and i have so much more to go and my lonely heart is beating so tired of the wonder there's a sign ahead though i think it's the same one again so i'm thinking 'bout my only friend till i find my way home   cause when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light   oh well the air is cold and yonder lies my sleeping soul by the branches broke like bones this weeping tree no longer holds oh well the night is still and i have not yet lost my will oh and i will keep on moving 'till until i find my way home   when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light  when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light  when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light when i need to get home you're my guiding light you're my guiding light
